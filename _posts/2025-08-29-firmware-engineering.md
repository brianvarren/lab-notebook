So I learned something interesting just now and I wanna make a note of it. I’ve been really bumping my head into organization as I try as I begin to tackle a more complex project this loop sampler is the most complex module I have ever attempted to build and the single file or single file plus one or two libraries or head files is not cutting it. This is going to require a much more Methodical and robust method of layering and organization in order to keep everything manageable so that I’m not scrolling through 3000 lines of code Trying to find where the mistake happened or something

Anyway, talking to Bob about like what you know how professionals do this and on the subject of drivers. He reminded me that like a driver is basically just a piece of software that handles. A driver is just a piece of a piece of code that gives you a reusable interface to a piece of hardware and reusable is the keyword

So now I’m thinking OK I need to go back through E encoder and rotary switch and even deck list and I need to figure out is are these libraries only surfacing generic reusable things I think they are but I just need to crystallize that idea in my mind that like Driver is just a more specific term for a library that exposes an interface to a hardware peripheral.







Short version: don’t big-bang the whole tree first. Grow it. Use a “strangler-vine” refactor: keep your working sketch, peel off one cohesive slice at a time, and only create folders/umbrella headers when you have >1 file in that domain.

Here’s exactly how Bob would do it with what you’ve got (minimal SD→PSRAM loader + U8g2 display + a ~200–300-line `loop-sampler.ino`):

# Step 0 — Freeze a working baseline

Tag/branch what works now so you can always get back to “last known good.”

# Step 1 — Create a tiny `/config` and stop scattering pin/size knobs

- `config/pins.h`: all GPIO, SPI/I2C/SPI1 chip selects, etc.
    
- `config/limits.h`: fixed sizes (max file count, filename length, block size) and any timing constants.
    
- `config/build_flags.h`: feature toggles if you need them later.
    

Keep these pure: only `#define`/`constexpr`, no code.

# Step 2 — Split display into “driver” vs “view” (one small cut)

Right now your `display.h` mixes hardware setup + drawing + UI text/scrolling. First split:

```
/src
  /display
    display_driver.h/.cpp   // owns U8g2 object, init(), clear(), update()
    display_views.h/.cpp    // draw primitives & current simple log/scroll view
```

- `display_driver.*` includes U8g2, pins, and exposes a pointer/ref to `U8G2& getU8g2()`.
    
- `display_views.*` is **draw-only**: it takes a `U8G2&` and renders “things” (status text, later your waveform). It should not know pins or SPI.
    

Keep your current text logger/scroll behavior in `display_views` so nothing breaks. Later you can add `waveform_view.*` without touching the driver.

# Step 3 — Split SD into “HAL/config” vs “services” (one small cut)

Your `sdcard.h` sounds like: pins + init + listing + WAV parsing + loader. First cut:

```
/src
  /storage
    sd_hal.h/.cpp        // pins, SdFat object, begin(), card size, low-level read
    file_index.h/.cpp    // list WAVs into fixed arrays (names[], sizes[])
    wav_meta.h/.cpp      // parse RIFF/WAVE header into a POD struct
    sample_loader.h/.cpp // read data into PSRAM (pmalloc), return speed/bytes
```

Keep function names you already call in `loop-sampler.ino` and just forward them to the new internals. That way your main sketch barely changes at first.

# Step 4 — Keep the sketch thin, but don’t chase purity yet

For now, let `loop-sampler.ino`:

- `#include "config/pins.h"`, `"display/display_driver.h"`, `"display/display_views.h"`, `"storage/sd_hal.h"`, `"storage/file_index.h"`, `"storage/wav_meta.h"`, `"storage/sample_loader.h"`.
    
- Call your same sequence (init PSRAM → SD begin → list WAVs → load first) and render messages via `display_views`.
    

When that compiles and runs exactly like today, **commit**.

# Step 5 — Add umbrella headers once a folder has >1 leaf

When `display/` and `storage/` each have 2+ files, add:

```
display/display.h     // #includes display_driver.h, display_views.h
storage/storage.h     // #includes sd_hal.h, file_index.h, wav_meta.h, sample_loader.h
```

Now your `.ino` can shrink to:

```cpp
#include "config/pins.h"
#include "display/display.h"
#include "storage/storage.h"
```

# Step 6 — Heuristics so you don’t over-split

- **Rule of three**: don’t make a new folder or layer until you have ~3 related things that would live there.
    
- **Cohesion first**: if two functions always change together, keep them together.
    
- **Directional deps**: views → driver interface (never hardware), services → HAL interface (never pins directly), app → services/views (glue only).
    

# Step 7 — Headers: what lives where

- Public headers: **interfaces + POD structs + `constexpr`**. Avoid `Arduino.h` unless truly needed.
    
- Source files: implementations, static helpers, any U8g2/SdFat includes.
    
- No global definitions in headers. Use `extern` in `.h`, define once in `.cpp`.
    
- Keep your memory rule: no `new`/`malloc`/`String`/STL. If you already use `String`, fence it to the UI path only and move to fixed `char[]` later.

// SD (SPI1 example)

```

**display/display_views.h**

```cpp
#pragma once
#include <stdint.h>
class U8G2;

void view_print_line(const char* text);  // simple logger you already use
void view_show_status(const char* title, const char* line2);
void view_draw_waveform(U8G2& u8g2,
                        const int16_t* samples, uint32_t count,
                        uint8_t channels, uint8_t bits,
                        const char* name);
```

**storage/sd_hal.h**

```cpp
#pragma once
#include <stdint.h>

bool sd_begin();                // init bus & card
float sd_card_size_mb();        // optional
int   sd_read(void* dst, uint32_t addr, uint32_t len); // low-level helper (if needed)
```

**storage/file_index.h**

```cpp
#pragma once
#include <stdint.h>
#include "config/limits.h"

struct FileIndex {
  char names[MAX_WAV_FILES][MAX_FILENAME_LEN];
  uint16_t count;
};

bool file_index_scan(FileIndex& idx);     // find *.wav
const char* file_index_get(const FileIndex&, int i);
```

**storage/wav_meta.h**

```cpp
#pragma once
#include <stdint.h>

struct WavInfo {
  uint32_t dataSize;
  uint32_t sampleRate;
  uint16_t numChannels;
  uint16_t bitsPerSample;
  // add fields as needed
};

bool wav_read_info(const char* path, WavInfo& out);
```

**storage/sample_loader.h**

```cpp
#pragma once
#include <stdint.h>

// Returns MB/s, writes bytesRead, and returns pointer via outData (pmalloc’d).
// Caller must pfree() when done.
float wav_load_psram(const char* path,
                     uint8_t** outData,
                     uint32_t* outSize,
                     uint32_t* bytesRead);
```

Then in your `.ino`, replace direct calls with these wrappers one by one (no need to convert everything the same day).

# Should config live “inside” the driver? (your SD/display question)

Early on, it’s fine. But the moment you want to:

- swap a pin,
    
- reuse the driver on another board,
    
- or test it in isolation,
    

you’ll be glad the **pins** live in `config/pins.h` and the driver only consumes them (or accepts them via `init(pins)`).

# TL;DR

- Don’t pre-scaffold a giant tree. Peel off one cohesive slice (display), then another (SD).
    
- Create folders only when you have multiple files that belong there.
    
- Add umbrella headers once you have more than one leaf in a folder.
    
- Keep pins/sizes in `/config`. Keep views draw-only. Keep services I/O-free.
    
- Make each step run exactly like today, then commit. Rinse, repeat.
    

If you want, Bob can take your current `display.h` and `sdcard.h` and show the _exact_ before→after diff into `display_driver.*`, `display_views.*`, `sd_hal.*`, `file_index.*`, `wav_meta.*`, and `sample_loader.*` so you can drop them in with minimal churn.
