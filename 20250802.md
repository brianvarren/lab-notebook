I'm at a fork now.

Flex-cv-in came in the mail yesterday, I tested it, made adjustments, and sent rev. B off to JLC.

Previously, I'd been working on the Olimex loop sampler firmware. Getting SD card to load into PSRAM.

Then I have these two unfinished oscillators, which I was trying to get V/oct working with. I'll probably just Bias the CV inputs at 1.65V with a simple voltage divider and capacitors (like flex-cv-in) and then work on the firmware from there. I should make a module that's just "knobs". fixed voltage offsets. That way I can just patch into jack-only inputs to tweak with a knob. And later I can use a mixer to add modulation to the eventual CV input.

I’m beginning to think that the OMX pico 2XXL is overkill for my loop sampler until I’m at the point where I have a stereo audio Kodak that can actually make use of the higher sample rate files that SD card and PS ram loading make possible.

I also want to return to this idea of momentum. You know I ordered the olimex because it really does make sense for a lot of the future future things that I may build, but I need to fill the rack first with a fleet of modular, utilities, and tools that I can build with currently existing technology with the micro controllers that I already have and I need to populate all of them and only when I run out of micro controllers do I feel like I will have earned the right to step up to creating bigger better boards.
