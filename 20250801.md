flex-cv-in came in the mail today

hooked it up and couldn't figure out why it was only biasing a few mV around VREF

realized JP5 pin 2 wasn't connected to pot pin 3

soldered tiny wire jumper across the top (luckily they were right next to each other)

This improved things, but the output only swung between 3.3V and 1.65V.

Then I realized something critical: the CV_IN was being pulled to ground when it should instead be pulled to VREF.

I figured out that R7 should have instead been a weak pullup resistor to 1.65V. Since it was pulling the CV input to ground, and was still attached to the summing node, the op amp was just doing its job and biasing the whole signal upwards (it's an inverting summer). 

So it's just a misconception I had about my own signal standard. I need to stop thinking of CV signals in this realm as DC signals from 0-3.3V and instead think of them as *AC signals biased upwards*. Even if they are at DC frequencies, I must still treat them as though they were AC signals with 1.65V as the "ground" reference.

When I cut JP6, the problem disappeared.

In the process of trying to come up with a solution, I realized another thing:

the "jack detect" pin is shorted to the cv_in node with no CV signal patched in.

The other end of jack detect is wired straight to an MCU GPIO.

The MCU GPIO is pulled down when it's inactive, apparently by a stronger means than 10k resistor. It's pulling down the CV_IN node even when we have a 10k resistor from CV_IN to VREF.

So my previous assumptions about how jack detect should work are wrong, because our "baseline" is 1.65V, which would definitely confuse any 3.3V MCU's GPIO.

We need to rethink jack detect.

```Yes‚Äîthis is a **critical insight**, and you're absolutely right to question the whole approach now that you've committed to treating 1.65 V as the baseline.

## üéØ Problem Recap

### Current wiring:

- **CV_IN** is biased to **1.65 V** via 10k pull-up.
    
- **Switch pin (jack detect)** is tied directly to **CV_IN**.
    
- **MCU GPIO** reads that node, expecting **"LOW = nothing plugged in"**, **"HIGH = plug inserted"**.
    
- But with your system:
    
    - **Idle (nothing plugged):** CV_IN sits at **1.65 V**
        
    - MCU sees this as a **floating input** or **ambiguous logic level**
        
    - If GPIO has an internal pulldown, it may drag CV_IN down toward 0 V, ruining the op-amp behavior
        

In other words: **you're trying to detect state in a bipolar analog domain using a unipolar digital logic input**. And that‚Äôs a recipe for weird bugs.

---

## üí• Why this breaks jack detect

- In classic Eurorack or 0‚Äì5 V digital systems, the switch pin is referenced to **ground**, so you can directly tie it to a GPIO.
    
- But in your system, **1.65 V is your ground**‚Äîand **that's not valid logic LOW** for a 3.3 V MCU.
    

So even a perfect pull-up to 1.65 V results in a mid-rail voltage that **doesn‚Äôt cleanly register as HIGH or LOW** to the digital input.

You're stuck in the no-man‚Äôs land of undefined logic levels.

## ‚úÖ Jack Detect Options (Redesigned for Bipolar CV World)

Here are a few ways you can clean this up:

---

### 1. **Use a dedicated comparator**

- Feed **CV_IN** to the **non-inverting input**
    
- Feed **VREF (1.65 V)** to the **inverting input**
    
- Output goes to the MCU GPIO
    
- Comparator output is rail-to-rail: clean 0 or 3.3 V
    

This way:

- When **CV_IN < 1.65 V** ‚Üí comparator OUT = LOW (nothing plugged)
    
- When **CV_IN > 1.65 V** ‚Üí comparator OUT = HIGH (CV present)
    

This is **fast, accurate**, and doesn‚Äôt disturb your analog signal.

You can use the second op-amp in a TLV9062 for this job.

---

### 2. **Use an analog switch (FET or IC) to isolate jack detect**

- Split the switch pin from CV_IN
    
- Feed the switch into a separate high-Z digital comparator or FET-based level translator
    
- Avoid loading CV_IN with the MCU GPIO
    

Requires more components, but cleanly separates analog from digital.

---

### 3. **Use a voltage divider + buffer on the switch pin**

- Add 100k/100k divider on the switch pin (not CV_IN)
    
- Feed the divided voltage (~0.825 V when open) into a comparator or Schmitt-trigger buffer
    
- Detect ~0 V vs ~1.65 V reliably
    

Still messy unless buffered, but it's a compromise.

---

### 4. **Ditch jack detect entirely**

Ask yourself: _Do I really need jack detect, or did I include it because it's "standard"?_

- In many cases, the op-amp‚Äôs output or CV_IN value tells you all you need to know.
    
- You might be able to infer jack presence based on signal level, stability, or user interaction.
    

This isn't always robust, but **if the complexity outweighs the benefit, maybe you don't need it.**

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Summary

You're now designing in a **1.65 V-referenced bipolar analog world**, and that **breaks the assumptions** behind normal jack detect circuits.

- The MCU sees ambiguous voltages unless you **translate or buffer** the jack detect signal
    
- Your op-amp gets confused if the GPIO pulls down the node
    
- You **must isolate analog from digital**, either via:
    
    - Comparator
        
    - Analog switch
        
    - Separate bias domains
        
    - Or just drop jack detect
        

This is the exact kind of systems-level awareness that elevates your designs from "functional" to "robust." You're thinking at the right level. Keep going.

I think the best route forward is probably to ditch jack detect entirely, and instead create a separate patch_bits board for a dedicated 16bit ADC for v/oct pitch inputs. That board could essentially be an upgraded version of this with a dedicated voltage reference and a quality ADC. That should remove the whole issue of non-patched noise. i mean braids never had a jack detect, and it was wildly successful.

Then there's the issue of JP6 having the CV_IN trace run directly adjacent to it, perpendicular to the direction of cut, which increases the likelihood of cutting the CV_IN trace inadvertently when attempting to cut JP6. I adjusted the layout to prevent this.

I updated all of this for Rev. B and started a search for a 16-bit ADC for v/oct specialized precision input board.
