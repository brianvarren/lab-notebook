Slept good last night.

Today, I swapped out the broken encoder for a new one. Verified that the file browsing and sd card loading works.

I had to adjust the main sketch a bit, there was a 10ms delay() at the end of the loop that was causing the encoder to respond sluggishly. In the process of debugging, I had Claude make improvements to the EEncoder.h library. Better sensitivity and more robust detection logic.

I also created a RotarySwitch.h library for use with the rotary-switch-shift patch_bits board that uses a shift register to multiplex pins for a rotary switch. This is because I fucking love using rotary switches and needed a cool way to condense the pin count for use in digital synth projects.

TODO:

- Integrate rotary switch behavior with an octave shift identifier on the display. LFO, -3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3.
- Implement waveform drawing when a waveform is loaded. This will also act as the "successfully loaded" message, since we'll draw directly from the contents of PSRAM buffer.
