## Combining SD card and PSRAM hardware tests
#### For use in Olimex Loop Sampler


- Used Claude Opus 4 w/ EXT to combine two previous hardware tests
- Worked on the second try due to a variable declared twice
- Initial SD load speed was pretty slow. ~15s to load "aggro ebow".
- Changed the sketch to measure load time instead of printing dots
- Initial load time: Load time: 16104.158 ms (0.36 MB/s)
- Changing block read size from 4096 to 32760 only gained ~1s faster load time (~15s total)
- Trying a version that will help
