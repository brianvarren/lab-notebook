Today's goal:

Finish voltage-sequencer firmware.

- Made some edits to the firmware
- Soldered a 10uF cap to the PWM filter for more filtering
- Assembled and mounted voltage-sequencer to the rack
- Ordered more USB cables and charger
- ChatGPT 5 rollout - derailed a bit since it was very buggy and upsetting at first
