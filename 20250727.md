Ruminations on sampling, sentience, and strange attractors // an [ongoing] SDIY lab notebook

It really all started with a Reaktor sampler that looked like this:

Dave Bristow had created this very simple instrument as an introduction to sampling in the spring 2018 quarter of a music tech program at Shoreline Community College that I had begun that year.

At the time, I had a vague understanding of sampling as simply playing sound files at specific points along a timeline, usually drums, and that was that. Having grown up playing around with FruityLoops 3 and being entirely too sheltered and ignorant of any actual professional electronic music production techniques, I had never considered sampling as having any potential for the tonal, textural, or abstract. FruityLoops was primarily a drum sequencer, and that formative early experience shaped my conception of the different modes of synthesis for nearly two decades.

Then I found myself in this sampling class, and suddenly the floodgates were thrown wide open. We had been tasked with creating an entire musical track using nothing but samplers.

For the task, we built several. A basic one-shot (above), a multisampler, several kinds of granular. And we ran around in class and at home, capturing field recordings, processing them, and crafting a small arsenal of instruments categorized by role, which were then used to compose. This was the result, if you care to listen. 

The project and its process brought me more joy and wonder than all of my previous musical endeavors combined. But what ended up sticking in the back of my mind, the one concept that kept begging to be expressed, explored, and expanded upon... was these two knobs:

To adjust the start and *length* of the loop.

Sometimes I find myself just sitting and listening to a portion of a sound loop over and over again, and I can't pull myself away. There is something about the rhythmic pulsating of the perfect loop point that acts as a drug for me.

I made variations on the theme, over the years. This was the next evolution:

It was built on the same Reaktor Primary macro which meant no low-level editing could be done to the underlying DSP. I just added some fun things on top of it: playback rate modulation, loop start randomization, effects.

Then I found this:

This was a block in Michael Hetrick's "Euro Reakt" series which utilized a Core Cell for its DSP. This meant you could see *and edit* the low-level behavior of the sampler.

I had been searching for something like this for a long time because I'd grown sick of the clicks and pops that were common each time playback wrapped to the loop start point, and I wanted to figure out a way to hack together a seamless, adjustable crossfade mechanism that worked independently of other conditions: playback rate, sample size, sample rate, etc.

I did that by duplicating the phasor that indexes the sample array, and tacking on a crossfade to the output that would act on a trigger received when the active phase was reset to zero. Not very elegant, but with the relatively infinite resources of the modern PC, the performance hit was invisible. 

That one looked like this:

And I used it, with a few refinements, as the basis for an instrument that was extremely tedious to use, but would give really awesome results especially when parameters were randomized within the correct bounds:

I've had this in the basement for a while and never released it, mostly because there are bugs that cause occasional crashes (presumably due to the very complex modulation routing that's been rather poorly implemented by me). Still, it has its charms. Sample clips below.

I hit a wall, though. I needed something more visceral. Something more immediate. Something tangible. That need led me on a meandering path to these:

This is an Olimex Pico2-XXL and it's really, really cool for a few reasons which I'll outline below.

1. There are eight ADC channels and all eight are exposed to its GPIO pins. This is pretty rare for off-the-shelf RP2040 or RP2350 based dev boards. Most have only four, and many of the newer RP2350 boards have only three. To me, more ADC pins mean more modulation inputs. That one is a no-brainer.
2. It comes with 8MB of QSPI PSRAM. Most RP2040 boards include some external flash memory, up to 16MB on some. Flash is great for storing static data like firmware or samples, but it’s slow to write and can’t be modified easily at runtime. PSRAM is fast enough to read and write dynamically while the program is running. This opens the door to easily loading samples from SD cards. Or, recording samples on the fly. And it also makes it possible to create reverbs that *actually sound decent*.
3. It has an SD card slot. Gigs and gigs of sample storage? Yes please.
4. RP2350 has a hardware floating point unit.
