Today's goal:

Finish the envelope.

Claude (Opus 4.1) had initially designed this with a loop-polling scheme with a delay(1) in there apparently to "prevent flooding the system". No triggers were being detected at all though.

Found the issue. The Seeed XIAO RP2040 lists digital pins differently than the RP2040's internal pins. I don't know why they do this. D9 = GP4.
